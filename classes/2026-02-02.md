# Second Meeting

## Logging In
* Root user can log into serial console (constty) without a password
* The [serial console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-serial-console.html) gives us access to the EC2 instance serial port, to troubleshoot booting, network config, and other issues

## Billing
* Consider privacy.com for virtual credit card billing

## Life Hacks
* Check out the SSH config to pre-configure some options to log in

## AWS
* Each region consists of 3+ isolated, separate availability zones (AZs; 1+ discrete data centers), physically separated by meaningful distance
* This provides redundancy and security in case of attack or disaster
* VPCs are logically isolated sections of the cloud, like private data centers, handling networking and keeping instances separate from other customers
* Security groups are a set of rules that define permitted actions (like a virtual firewall) to control incoming/outgoing traffic
* Per region: 
  * VPCs
  * Security groups
  * AMIs
  * Key pairs
* Per availability zone:
  * Subnets
  * Volumes

## Storage
### Disk Configs
* How do we put multiple disks together to make a bigger disk? JBOD, RAID, Flash Array
